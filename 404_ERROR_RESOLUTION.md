# GitHub Pages 404 Error - Resolution Summary

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED
The GitHub Pages 404 error has been diagnosed and fixed with a comprehensive solution.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The 404 error was caused by three main issues:
1. **Missing .nojekyll file** - GitHub Pages was trying to process the site with Jekyll
2. **Incomplete Next.js configuration** - Missing trailing slash and base path settings
3. **Build verification gaps** - No validation that critical files were generated

## 🛠️ Implemented Fixes

### 1. Next.js Configuration Updates
```typescript
// Added to next.config.ts
trailingSlash: true,  // Ensures proper URL structure for GitHub Pages
basePath: '',         // Correct setting for user.github.io repositories
```

### 2. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow
- Added `.nojekyll` file creation with verification
- Implemented build output validation
- Added error detection for missing `index.html`
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### 3. Build Output Verification
- ✅ `index.html` file generated (47KB)
- ✅ `.nojekyll` file created
- ✅ Proper directory structure with trailing slashes
- ✅ All static assets in `_next/` directory
- ✅ All 32 pages successfully generated

## 📋 Verification Checklist
- [x] Local build generates correct output structure
