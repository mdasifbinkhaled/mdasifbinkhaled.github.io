            <p>
              I am {siteConfig.author}, a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science
              and Engineering with a profound passion for both education and
              research. My academic and professional pursuits are driven by a
              commitment to developing intelligent systems that can make a
              significant positive impact, particularly within the healthcare
              domain.
            </p>
            <p>
              My core research focuses on Explainable AI (XAI) and Multimodal AI
              (MMAI), with a specialized interest in their applications to
              healthcare. I firmly believe that the future of medical
              diagnostics and treatment can be revolutionized by AI systems that
              are not only highly accurate but also transparent, interpretable,
              and capable of processing diverse data sources such as medical
              images, clinical notes, and lab results.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an educator, I am dedicated to inspiring students to explore
              the vast and exciting potential of computer science. I am a strong
              advocate for Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and employ diverse
              pedagogical strategies to cultivate critical thinking, robust
              problem-solving skills, and a genuine enthusiasm for lifelong
              learning. My aim is to empower the next generation of engineers
              and researchers with the essential knowledge and tools to
              innovate, excel, and lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond my teaching and research activities, I am actively engaged
              in the academic community by mentoring students, contributing to
              professional service, and continuously seeking opportunities for
              growth. I am currently pursuing PhD opportunities to further
              deepen my research expertise and contribute to pioneering
              advancements in AI for healthcare and beyond.
