# Navigation Optimization & Content Consolidation Plan

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: PROPOSAL - Awaiting Approval  
**Priority**: HIGH - Improves UX and Information Architecture

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the current navigation structure, content distribution, and best practices for academic portfolios, I recommend **consolidating navigation from 8 items to 6 items** and **merging redundant pages** to create a clearer, more intuitive user experience.

### Key Findings

#### Current Issues

1. **Navigation Overload**: 8 navigation items exceeds the optimal 5-7 range recommended by UX research
2. **Content Fragmentation**: Related information split across multiple pages
3. **Redundancy**: Experience + CV overlap, Service & Awards separate from About despite overlap
4. **User Journey Confusion**: Too many choices create decision paralysis

#### Proposed Solution

**Reduce to 6 navigation items:**

| #   | Current (8 items) | Proposed (6 items) | Action              |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1   | Home              | Home               | ✅ Keep             |
| 2   | About Me          | About              | ✅ Keep + Enhance   |
| 3   | Experience        | ~~removed~~        | ❌ Merge into About |
| 4   | Research          | Research           | ✅ Keep             |
| 5   | Publications      | Publications       | ✅ Keep             |
| 6   | Teaching          | Teaching           | ✅ Keep             |
| 7   | Service & Awards  | ~~removed~~        | ❌ Merge into About |
| 8   | Contact           | Contact            | ✅ Keep             |

**Impact**: 25% reduction in navigation complexity while preserving all content

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Current Navigation Structure

```
Home → About Me → Experience → Research → Publications → Teaching → Service & Awards → Contact
└─────────────────────── 8 ITEMS ───────────────────────┘
```

**Problems:**

- **Cognitive Load**: 8 items forces users to scan all options before deciding
- **Mobile UX**: 8 items creates cramped mobile menu
- **Unclear Hierarchy**: Which pages are most important?
- **Content Overlap**: About/Experience/CV all contain biographical info

### 2. User Journey Analysis

#### Target Audiences & Their Needs

| Audience              | Primary Need                 | Navigation Path                | Current Issues                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **PhD Recruiters**    | Publications, Research, CV   | Home → Publications → Research | CV link hidden, Experience separate |
| **Students**          | Teaching info, Contact       | Home → Teaching → Contact      | Too many options to reach Teaching  |
| **Collaborators**     | Research areas, Publications | Home → Research → Publications | Research vs Publications confusing  |
| **Hiring Committees** | Complete profile             | Home → About → CV              | About/Experience/Awards fragmented  |

### 3. Content Distribution Analysis

#### About Page (Current)

**Current Sections:**

- ✅ Hero
- ✅ Quick Facts (location, position, focus, goal)
- ✅ Highlights Stats (15+ pubs, 1000+ students, 6x awards, 4 grants)
- ✅ My Journey & Vision (biography)
- ✅ Education (M.Sc, B.Sc)
- ✅ Beyond Academia (amateur radio, community)
- ✅ Certifications (5 items)
- ✅ Let's Connect CTA

**Missing (Should Add):**

- ❌ Work Experience (currently on /experience)
- ❌ Technical Skills (currently on /experience)
- ❌ Honors & Awards detail (currently on /service-awards - 8 awards!)
- ❌ Professional Service (currently on /service-awards - 7 roles!)

#### Experience Page (To Merge)

**Content:**

- Professional Experience Timeline (detailed work history)
- Technical Skills (4 categories: Programming, Data Analysis, Tools, ML/DL)

**Rationale for Merging:**

- Overlaps with CV content
- Biographical information belongs with "About"
- No PhD-focused portfolio has separate "Experience" page
- Skills can enhance About page comprehensively

#### Service & Awards Page (To Merge)

**Content:**

- 8 Honors & Awards (6x VC Awards, Best Intern, Programming Contest)
- 7 Professional Service Roles (IEEE mentor, BUCC VP, GDG ambassador, etc.)

**Rationale for Merging:**

- About page already mentions "6x VC Awards" in stats
- Creates duplication and fragmentation
- Awards are biographical achievements (belong in About)
- Service demonstrates character (fits "Beyond Academia" theme)

---

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1: Enhance About Page

#### 1.1 Add Work Experience Section

**Location**: After Education, Before Beyond Academia

**Content Structure:**

```
Work Experience
├── Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB)
│   ├── Senior Lecturer (Sep 2024 - Present)
│   └── Lecturer (May 2018 - Aug 2024)
├── BRAC University (BRACU)
│   └── Teaching Assistant/Lab Instructor (Jan 2017 - Aug 2017)
└── Tech Geeks Ltd.
    └── Software Engineering Intern (Jan 2016 - Apr 2016)
```

**Design**: Timeline cards with hover effects (matching existing About style)

#### 1.2 Add Technical Skills Section

**Location**: After Work Experience

**Content**: 4 skill categories with badges (Programming, Data Analysis, Tools, ML/DL)

**Design**: Grid of cards with icons, matching existing Quick Facts style

#### 1.3 Add Honors & Awards Section

**Location**: After Certifications

**Content**: 8 awards with institution, date, icon

**Design**: Grid layout (3 columns) with trophy/medal/star icons

#### 1.4 Enhance Professional Service

**Approach**: Expand "Beyond Academia" section to include professional service roles

**Current "Beyond Academia":**

- Amateur Radio Operations
- Community Engagement

**Enhanced "Beyond Academia & Service":**

- Amateur Radio Operations
- Community Engagement
- **+ Professional Service** (IEEE mentor, BUCC VP, GDG ambassador - top 3-4 roles)
- Link to full service history in footer or CV

### Phase 2: Update Navigation

#### 2.1 Remove Navigation Items

**Files to Update:**

- `src/shared/config/navigation.ts` - Remove Experience and Service & Awards from mainNavItems
- `src/shared/components/navigation/navbar.tsx` - Update items array (remove 2 items)

**New Navigation:**

```typescript
export const mainNavItems: NavItem[] = [
  { href: '/', label: 'Home', icon: 'Home', sectionId: 'home' },
  { href: '/about', label: 'About', icon: 'UserCircle', sectionId: 'about' },
  { href: '/research', label: 'Research', icon: 'Cpu', sectionId: 'research' },
  {
    href: '/publications',
    label: 'Publications',
    icon: 'BookOpenText',
    sectionId: 'publications',
  },
  {
    href: '/teaching',
    label: 'Teaching',
    icon: 'Presentation',
    sectionId: 'teaching',
  },
  { href: '/contact', label: 'Contact', icon: 'Send', sectionId: 'contact' },
];
```

#### 2.2 Set Up Redirects

**Purpose**: Preserve SEO and external links

**Implementation** (`next.config.ts`):

```typescript
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/experience',
      destination: '/about#experience',
      permanent: true, // 301 redirect
    },
    {
      source: '/service-awards',
      destination: '/about#honors-awards',
      permanent: true,
    },
  ];
}
```

### Phase 3: Update Homepage (Optional Enhancement)

**Current Status**: Already optimized (removed Brief Bio)

**Consideration**: Homepage currently has 8 sections. Could optionally reduce to 6-7 by combining:

- Quick Stats + News into one section
- Publications preview + Featured Grant into one "Featured Work" section

**Recommendation**: **Keep as-is** for now. Homepage serves as comprehensive overview and is distinct from About (personal story).
