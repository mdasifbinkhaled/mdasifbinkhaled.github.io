## Detailed Similarity Analysis

### üî¥ CRITICAL OVERLAPS (Must Fix)

#### 1. "Open to PhD Opportunities" Badge

**Homepage:**

```tsx
<div className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-primary/20 to-accent/20 text-primary px-4 py-2 text-sm rounded-full font-semibold my-2 shadow-md border border-primary/30 hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105 transition-all duration-300">
  <span className="relative flex h-2 w-2">
    <span className="animate-ping absolute inline-flex h-full w-full rounded-full bg-primary opacity-75"></span>
    <span className="relative inline-flex rounded-full h-2 w-2 bg-primary"></span>
  </span>
  Open to PhD Opportunities
</div>
```

**About Page:**

```tsx
<Badge
  variant="outline"
  className="text-sm px-4 py-1.5 border-primary/30 bg-primary/5"
>
  <Sparkles className="w-3 h-3 mr-1.5 inline" />
  Open to PhD Opportunities
</Badge>
```

**Issue:** Identical message, nearly identical styling  
**Impact:** User sees same badge on two consecutive pages  
**Recommendation:** Keep on Homepage only (it's the first impression)

---

#### 2. Research Interests Section

**Homepage:**

- 6 research areas in 3-column grid
- Detailed cards with icons and descriptions
- Areas: AI in Healthcare, AI in Environment, XAI, Multimodal AI, Remote Sensing, Algorithms & Data Structures
- Left border accent colors (red, green, blue, purple, orange, amber)

**About Page:**

- 4 research areas in 2-column grid
- Similar cards with icons and descriptions
- Areas: AI in Healthcare, XAI, Multimodal AI, Computer Vision
- Icon colors (red, yellow, purple, blue)

**Overlap:** 3 out of 4 areas are identical (75% overlap)

- ‚úì AI in Healthcare (both)
- ‚úì Explainable AI/XAI (both)
- ‚úì Multimodal AI/MMAI (both)
- ‚úó Computer Vision (About only)
- ‚úó AI in Environment (Homepage only)
- ‚úó Remote Sensing (Homepage only)
- ‚úó Algorithms & Data Structures (Homepage only)

**Issue:** Near-duplicate content with slightly different styling  
**Impact:** Visitors feel they're reading the same information twice  
**User Confusion:** "Is this the same page? Why am I seeing this again?"

---

#### 3. Quick Stats/Highlights Cards

**Homepage (Quick Stats):**

- 7+ Years Teaching
- 4.0+ Teaching Score
- 4 Research Grants
- 5+ Research Areas

**About Page (Highlights Stats):**

- 15+ Publications
- 1000+ Students Taught

**Overlap:** "4 Research Grants" appears on both pages  
**Issue:** 25% content overlap in stats sections  
**Impact:** Reduces uniqueness of each page

---

### üü° MODERATE OVERLAPS (Should Fix)

#### 4. Hero Section Description

**Homepage:**

```
Specializing in Explainable AI (XAI) and Multimodal AI (MMAI)
for healthcare diagnostics and analytics.
```

**About Page:**

```
Senior Lecturer and Researcher dedicated to advancing AI in healthcare
through transparent and innovative solutions.
```

**Overlap:** Both emphasize XAI/MMAI in healthcare  
**Issue:** Similar messaging, different wording  
**Recommendation:** Homepage should be tagline, About should be full narrative

---

#### 5. Brief Bio vs My Journey & Vision

**Homepage (Brief Bio):**

```
I am a dedicated researcher and educator with expertise in developing
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare. My work focuses on creating
interpretable machine learning models that bridge the gap between

impact, particularly within the healthcare domain.
```

**Overlap:** Both introduce you as a researcher/educator focused on healthcare AI  
**Issue:** Homepage has a brief bio that overlaps with About page's narrative  
**Recommendation:** Remove detailed bio from Homepage (it's for About page)

---

#### 6. Call-to-Action Buttons

**Homepage Hero:**

- "Explore Research" (primary)
- "View CV" (outline)

**About Page Hero:**

- "Download CV" (primary)

**Homepage Footer (Connect & Collaborate):**

- "Get in Touch" (primary)

**About Page Footer (Let's Connect):**

- "Contact Me" (primary)
- LinkedIn, Google Scholar, ORCID buttons

**Overlap:** Both have contact CTAs, both have CV links  
**Issue:** Redundant CTAs confuse user journey  
**User Question:** "Where should I actually contact them?"

---

#### 7. Social Links / Academic Profiles

**Homepage:**

- Full "Connect & Collaborate" section
- 6 profile cards: Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, GitHub, LinkedIn, Email
- Centered layout with icons and labels
- "Get in Touch" button at bottom

## Strategic Recommendations

### Approach A: Minimal Changes (Quick Fix)

**Focus:** Remove duplicates, keep both pages substantial

1. ‚úÖ **Remove PhD badge from About page** (keep on Homepage only)
2. ‚úÖ **Remove Research Interests from About page** (Homepage has better version)
3. ‚úÖ **Remove Research Grants stat from Homepage** (About page focuses on achievements)
4. ‚úÖ **Remove Brief Bio from Homepage** (About page is for biography)
5. ‚úÖ **Consolidate social links to About page** (remove from Homepage)

**Pros:** Quick to implement, minimal disruption  
**Cons:** Pages may feel incomplete, doesn't solve root problem

---

### Approach B: Clear Differentiation (Recommended)

**Focus:** Give each page a distinct purpose and content strategy

#### Homepage (Landing Page) - "Why Should They Care?"

**Purpose:** First impression, quick overview, drive action

**Keep:**

- ‚úÖ Hero with name, tagline, PhD badge
- ‚úÖ Quick Stats (4 cards)
- ‚úÖ News section (recent achievements)
- ‚úÖ Research Interests (6 areas) - THE comprehensive overview
- ‚úÖ Recent Publications (3-5 items)
- ‚úÖ Work Experience (current + recent)
- ‚úÖ Featured Grant
- ‚úÖ Connect & Collaborate (full social links)

**Remove/Reduce:**

- ‚ùå Brief Bio (too detailed for Homepage)
- ‚ùå Research Grants stat (move to About)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Simplify Research Interests to high-level overview (keep cards but shorter descriptions)

**Adjust:**

- Make tagline more impactful: "Building Trustworthy AI for Healthcare"
- CTAs: "Explore Research" + "Learn About Me" (link to About)
- Keep it scannable, visual, achievement-focused

---

#### About Page (Personal Story) - "Who Are They?"

**Purpose:** Deep dive into personal journey, education, background

**Keep:**

- ‚úÖ Hero with tagline (different from Homepage)
- ‚úÖ Quick Facts card (location, position, focus, goal)
- ‚úÖ Highlights Stats (publications, students, awards, grants)
- ‚úÖ My Journey & Vision (full biography)
- ‚úÖ Education section
- ‚úÖ Beyond Academia (personality)
- ‚úÖ Certifications
- ‚úÖ Let's Connect footer

**Remove:**

- ‚ùå PhD badge (redundant with Homepage)
- ‚ùå Research Interests section (Homepage has comprehensive version)

**Adjust:**

- Change hero tagline to: "Educator, Researcher, Lifelong Learner"
- Expand biography to include more personal story
- Add timeline visualization (optional)
- Focus on journey, not just facts

---

### Approach C: Radical Redesign (Advanced)

**Focus:** Merge or completely reimagine page purposes

**Option 1: Merge About into Homepage**

- Create tabbed interface on Homepage
- Tabs: Overview | About Me | Research | Publications | Contact
- Single-page experience with deep sections
- **Pros:** No redundancy, modern design
- **Cons:** Long page, may hurt SEO

**Option 2: Split About into Multiple Pages**

- `/about` - Brief bio + quick facts
- `/about/education` - Detailed education
- `/about/certifications` - Certifications
- `/about/philosophy` - Teaching/research philosophy
- **Pros:** Granular control
- **Cons:** More complex navigation

---

## Detailed Change Recommendations

### üî¥ Priority 1: Critical Duplications (Do First)

#### Change 1: Remove PhD Badge from About Page

**File:** `src/app/about/page.tsx`

```tsx
<Badge variant="outline" className="...">
  <Sparkles className="w-3 h-3 mr-1.5 inline" />
  Open to PhD Opportunities
</Badge>
```

**After:** (Remove entirely)

**Rationale:** Homepage is the first impression, should have this badge

---

#### Change 2: Remove Research Interests Section from About Page

**File:** `src/app/about/page.tsx`  
**Action:** Delete entire `<section id="research-interests">` block

**Rationale:**

- Homepage has 6 research areas (comprehensive)
- About has 4 areas (75% overlap)
- Homepage is better suited for research overview
- About should focus on personal journey

**Alternative:** Replace with "Research Philosophy" section explaining your approach to research (unique content)

---

#### Change 3: Differentiate Stats Sections

**Homepage:** Keep focus on career metrics

- 7+ Years Teaching
- 4.0+ Teaching Score
- **Remove:** 4 Research Grants (move to About)
- 5+ Research Areas

**About Page:** Keep focus on achievements

- 15+ Publications
- 1000+ Students Taught
- 6x VC Awards
- 4 Research Grants

**Rationale:** Each page has unique metrics

---

### üü° Priority 2: Content Optimization

#### Change 4: Remove Brief Bio from Homepage

**File:** `src/app/page.tsx`  
**Action:** Delete the "Brief Bio Section" after Quick Stats

**Before:**

```tsx
{
  /* Brief Bio Section - NEW */
}
<div className="mt-[var(--space-section-sm)] max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">
  <p className="text-lg text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
    I am a dedicated researcher and educator...
  </p>
</div>;
```

**After:** (Remove entirely)

**Rationale:**

- Homepage should be scannable, not detailed

```tsx
<div className="flex gap-3 justify-center flex-wrap">
  <Button asChild size="lg">
    <Link href="/contact">Contact Me</Link>
  </Button>
  <Button asChild variant="outline" size="lg">
    <Link href="/">View All Social Links</Link>
  </Button>
</div>
```

**Alternative:** Keep 2 most important links (LinkedIn + Email) on About, rest on Homepage

---

#### Change 6: Update About Page Hero Tagline

**Current:**

```
Senior Lecturer and Researcher dedicated to advancing AI in healthcare
through transparent and innovative solutions.
```

**Recommended:**

```
Educator at Heart, Researcher by Passion
