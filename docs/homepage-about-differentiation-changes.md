# Homepage and About Page Differentiation Changes

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Objective**: Reduce content overlap from ~75-80% to <20% by implementing clear differentiation strategy

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented **Approach B: Clear Differentiation** to give each page a distinct purpose while maintaining minimalist design principles.

### Pages Updated

- `src/app/page.tsx` (Homepage)
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` (About Page)

## Changes Made

### 1. About Page (`src/app/about/page.tsx`)

#### Removed PhD Badge (100% Duplicate)

**Before**: Badge with "Open to PhD Opportunities" appeared on both pages  
**After**: Removed from About page, kept only on Homepage

**Rationale**: PhD badge is an achievement indicator better suited for first impression (Homepage), not personal story (About page).

#### Removed Research Interests Section (75% Overlap)

**Before**: About page had 4 research interest cards (Healthcare AI, XAI, MMAI, Computer Vision)  
**After**: Completely removed this section from About page

**Rationale**:

- Homepage already has comprehensive 6-area Research Interests section
- 3 out of 4 areas were duplicates (75% overlap)
- About page should focus on personal journey, not research overview

**Code Changes**:

- Removed `researchInterests` data array
- Removed Research Interests section JSX
- Cleaned up unused imports: `Sparkles`, `Code`, `Heart` (kept Heart for Beyond Academia section)
- Removed `Badge` component import

#### Updated Hero Tagline

**Before**: "Senior Lecturer and Researcher dedicated to advancing AI in healthcare through transparent and innovative solutions."

**After**: "My journey in artificial intelligence research and education, from curiosity-driven exploration to advancing healthcare through transparent AI solutions."

**Rationale**: More personal, story-focused language instead of achievement-focused.

### 2. Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)

#### Removed Brief Bio Section (60% Overlap)

**Before**: Full paragraph about building trustworthy AI systems for healthcare  
**After**: Removed entire Brief Bio card section

**Rationale**:

- Content overlapped 60% with About page's "My Journey & Vision" section
- Homepage should be overview/highlights, not detailed biography
- Full story belongs on About page

**Code Changes**:

- Removed entire Brief Bio Card component
- Maintained Quick Stats section that follows hero

## Technical Validation

### Build Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ ESLint: No errors
- ✅ Production build: Successful
- ✅ All routes generated: 28/28
- ✅ No runtime errors

### Bundle Size

| Route    | Size  | First Load JS | Change  |
| -------- | ----- | ------------- | ------- |
| `/`      | ~5KB  | 150 KB        | Slight  |
| `/about` | ~174B | 111 KB        | Reduced |

**Note**: About page size reduced due to removed sections.

## Design Principles Maintained

✅ **Minimalist**: Removed redundant content, not added new complexity  
✅ **Informative**: Each page now has clear, distinct purpose  
✅ **No Over-Engineering**: Simple deletions, no complex refactoring  
✅ **User-Focused**: Clear navigation path (Home → About for deeper dive)

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Navigation Flow**:
   - Homepage → Quick overview, hook visitors
   - About → Personal story for engaged users

2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
   - No more "wait, didn't I just read this?" moments
   - Each page serves distinct purpose

3. **Better SEO**:
   - Distinct content for each page
   - Clear separation of concerns

## Recommendations

### Future Considerations

1. **Social Links Consolidation** (Optional):
   - Currently both pages have social/profile links
   - Consider: Keep full 6 profiles on Homepage, simple email CTA on About
   - Impact: Further ~5% overlap reduction

2. **Stats Differentiation** (Optional):
   - Homepage: Impact metrics (years teaching, score, grants, areas)
   - About: Personal stats (publications, students, awards)
   - Currently: Some overlap in "4 Research Grants" stat

3. **Call-to-Action Variation**:
   - Homepage: "View CV" + "Contact Me" (dual CTAs)
   - About: Simple "Get in Touch" footer
   - Currently: Working well, differentiated
